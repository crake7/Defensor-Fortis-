ARP SPOOFER:
This file contains two arp spoofer tools to run an arp spoofing attack and redirect the flow of packets
in the network. As a result, you will be able to intercept data and become MITM. 

Please note there is a difference between: arp_spoofy_cmmdlineargs.py and arp_spoofy.py:

--arp_spoofy_cmmdlineargs.py needs you to input <target_IP> <gateway_IP> or <help> commands directly
on the Linux bash terminal.
Example: python3 arp_spoofy_cmmdlineargs.py -IPt 10.0.0.2 -IPg 10.0.0.1 

--arp_spoofy.py needs you to input the <target_ip> and <gateway_ip> in the code itself.
Use "cat arp_spoofy.py" to inspect the content of the program.

Once you have successfuly established a connection (and you are running the program in the terminal), you will
need to allow PORT FORWARDING so the victim machine can have regular access to the internet. There are several ways
to achieve this, I suggest typing on Linux bash terminal: 
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

 
ARP SPOOFER DETECTOR
In addition, arp_spoofy_detector.py detects ARP spoofing attacks. You may need to input the <NIC> you'd like
to sniff directly into the program. 
Use "cat apr_spoofy_detector.py" to inspect the content of the program.
