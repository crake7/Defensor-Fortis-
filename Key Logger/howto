Key Logger folder contains two files: one is the configuration of the Key Logger class, and the other is an example of how to use it. 

KLogger.py will take three inputs: <timer in seconds>, <email> and <password>. 
-Timer in seconds: how often do you want to recieve an email with the results of the program.
-Email: which Gmail account would you use.
-Password: pretty self-explanatory, I hope.

As you may notice, the keylogger.py class will use Gmail's public SMTP server to send you the updates. Thus, you need to enable LESS SECURE APPS
in your Gmail account configurations.
