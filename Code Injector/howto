CODE INJECTOR injects code in intercepted HTML pages, this folder contains two files: BeEF and Javascript. 
You may use this program with a target who will use HTTP or HTTPS. Check the README file to learn how to bypass HTTPS.

Before running the program:
1. You will need to intercept the packets from the target computer and forward them. 
If you do not need to bypass HTTPS, you will need to type the following command on the Linux bash terminal:
iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

You will also need to allow the target to have internet connection. Type in the terminal:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Instead, if you are using SSL STRIP, you only need to type in the terminal:
iptables -I OUTPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
iptables -I OUTPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

code_injector_beEF.py assumes you are using BeEF framework and has been already configured. 
Yoy may need to modify <injection_code> variable within the code itself.
Use "cat code_injector_beEF.py" to inspect the content of the file and replace the example IP address with your
system's IP address. 

code_injector_javascript.py currently uses a weak javascript code to inject to the HTML page as an example. 
You need to insert the javascript code you want to insert within the HTML page. 

Please note you will only be able to inject code once you have become MITM. Use the ARP SPOOFER program in this 
suite of tools to achieve this.
