PACKET SNIFFER:
This program filters intercepted data and has the potential to show usernames, passwords, visited links, etc.
(Please note you will need to bypass HTTPS to achieve this.)

Requirements:
-Become MITM. You may use ARP SPOOFER program in this suite tools to achieve this.
-I strongly recommend bypassing HTTPS to get the most results from this program. 

packet_sniffer.py currently uses a sample list of basic keywords to fetch Login informatiom from the packets sent.
You might want to add words to this list. Use "cat packet_sniffer.py" to see the program. 
You also need to change the <NIC> to the interface you will be sniffing from.
