The BACKDOOR folder contains two main files: a Listener and a Backdoor file. 
You will need to run the Listener whenever you want your compromised systems to connect to your system. The backdoor file will create a reverse
connection so the target computer will connect back to the hacker using port 4444.

First, let's have a look at how the Listener.py file works:

1. The program will need you to input your <IP address> and the <PORT> number you will use to connect to the victim computer. 
Currently, the backdoor file is using port 4444, you I suggest you input this port number if you do not wish to modify the program file.
(Remember to use a port that is not being used by your system, otherwise it will not work.)

2. This program allows the following features:
-Downloading files (Uses serialization converting files into JSON objects.) Type in: "download ___"
-Uploading files (Uses serialization converting files into JSON objects.) Type in: "upload _____"
-Navegate throught the file system. Type in: "cd ____" #Do not use relative paths. 

3. When you want to close the connection, simply type in the terminal:
"exit"
